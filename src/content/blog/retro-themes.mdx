# üé® The Art of Retro Themes

Welcome to a special blog post where we'll explore the different retro themes available on this website. Each theme has been designed by me to capture the essence of a specific era in computing history.

## How to Switch Themes

You can easily switch between these themes using the theme switcher at the top of every page. Your preference will be saved in local Storage for future visits.

## Technical Implementation

For the curious developers out there, here's how our themes work:

```css
:root {
	/* Theme variables */
	--theme-primary: #c0c0c0;
	--theme-secondary: #000080;
	--theme-background: #008080;
	--theme-text: #000000;
}

/* Theme-specific overrides */
.theme-win95 {
	--theme-primary: #c0c0c0;
	/* Windows 95 specific variables */
}

.theme-mac-os-9 {
	--theme-primary: #e8e8e8;
	/* Mac OS 9 specific variables */
}
```

## What's Next?

I always working on new themes and improvements. Some ideas for future themes include:

- Commodore 64
- Amiga Workbench
- DOS Interface

Stay tuned for more retro goodness!
