# Hello, World Wide Web! üåê

Welcome to my new blog! This website was created mainly for blog content. I'm super excited to share my thoughts with you in this nostalgic corner of the internet. This blog is designed to capture the essence of the early web, and to document my journey in web development. When I learn new technology and I manage to explain it in a blog post, then I know I understand it. Why retro themes? Things were simpler back then and every website had its own unique personality - designs didn't matter.

## Why a 90s Theme? üï∞Ô∏è

The 1990s and early 2000 were a special time for the internet. It was an era of:

- Personal homepages filled with personality
- Guestbooks where visitors could leave their mark
- Web rings connecting like-minded sites
- Under construction GIFs everywhere
- The iconic "Best viewed in Netscape Navigator" badges

## About This Site üíª

This blog is built with modern technology (Astro) but styled to look like it's straight out of 1995. You can even switch between different retro themes to experience various nostalgic styles:

- Windows 95 - The classic grey interface we all remember
- Mac OS 9 - Apple's sleek platinum design
- Web 1999 - Pure 90s web aesthetic with bright colors
- Games - Retro gaming them with the bride colors and flush animations

## What's Next? üöÄ

I'll be posting about:

- Retro computing and web design
- Modern development with a nostalgic twist
- Stories what i learn using new tools
- And much more!

Don't forget to sign my guestbook on the home page! And remember: this site is always under construction! üöß

```js
// A bit of nostalgic code
alert('Welcome to my website!');
document.write('Thanks for visiting!');
```
